		<h1>Lab 8: CSS Selectors</h1>
		<h2>Big Idea</h2>
			<p class="style">The goal for this lab is teach us about classes of styling and nesting those styles ot create a unique looking result.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p class="style">The most difficult part of this lab was playing around with the css styles until I found something that I liked.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p class="style">This lab expanded on the aspects of a css file we learned about in the last lab. I feel as though I learned how to make a more personalized website and how to organize my page more neatly.</p>
