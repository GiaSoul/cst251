		<h1>Lab 7: Intro to CSS</h1>
		<h2>Big Idea</h2>
			<p>The goal for this lab is to let us play around with our css file until we are satisfied with its new look.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Figuring out what each aspect of the preset css file did was the most confusing but rewarding part.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>This lab really allowed me to learn what many of the aspects of a css file do. I enjoy the new look of my page and I look forward to further customizing my webpages.</p>
