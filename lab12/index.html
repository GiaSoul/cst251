    <h1>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had small struggles with making the element's images look right on my page because of their varying sizes. </p>

    <h1>Results</h2>
    <p>I enjoyed this lab becuase it implemented many aspects used in modern website design such as sticky menus and links. This could be very useful for creating annoying pop-ups and ads.</p>
