		<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
		<p>The goal for this lab is to demonstrate our ability to publish our webpage using files from our computer through github.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The biggest challenge I faced was making sure I didn't forget to Screenshot any part of the assignment.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>This lab was simple becuase we had completed most of these taks togather in previous classes. However, I now feel more comfortable inserting files from my computer into my web page and making sure it works correctly.</p>
