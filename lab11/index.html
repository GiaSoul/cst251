    <h1>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had small struggles with making the element's images look right on my page because of their varying sizes. </p>
    <h1>Problems</h2>
    <p>I faced little to no problems completing this lab. It was easy to follow the directions for this lab on ilearn.</p>
    <h1>Results</h2>
    <p>I enjoyed this lab becuase it implemented many aspects used in modern website design such as sticky menus and links. This could be very useful for creating annoying pop-ups and ads.</p>
