  <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>there was no challenges for this lab. I felt this to be quite easy thanks to the lecture that Mr. Wes provided.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>Only personal problem I had with lab is the pictures. Are they supposed to be that small? He did ask for 100 to 150 pixels wide but it looks so tiny but other than that I had no issues.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I like how this page looks. It splits the browser down the middle and would show other things that I would want to put in the middle. Good for organizing.</p>
