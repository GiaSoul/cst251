  <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge we faced was appropriately sizing everything on our page. We eventually found a size and spacing that looked good.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>The only difference with our fake site the colors of some of the text is off because it would be difficult to read on the orange of our background.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Our page turned out very similar to that of which we were mocking. If we had the exact font it would have looked better.</p>
