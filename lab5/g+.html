		<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
			<p>The goal for this lab is to introduce us to the concept of making a more personalized webpage and to let us demonstrate our ability to inset images and links into an HTML document.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The thing that took the most time was making sure I inserted my links correcly because it weas my first time doing that.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>This lab is engaging because we were able to use a lot of our own content to demonstrate our abilities.</p>
