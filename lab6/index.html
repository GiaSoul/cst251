		<h2>Big Idea</h2>
			<p>The goal for this lab is to introduce us to the use of css to create a better looking website.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The aspect that took the most time was making sure I linked to the css file correctly because I had not done this before.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I enjoyed this lab because I was excited to work with css files and this was our first taste of doing that.</p>
