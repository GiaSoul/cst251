  <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>One challence we faced was that the paragraps were moving around too much as we adjusted the size of the window.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>The biggest problem was adjusting the aspects of the page to line up correctly</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Our page turned out very similar to that of which we were mocking.</p>
