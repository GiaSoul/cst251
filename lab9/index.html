		<h1>Lab 9: Styling Block Elements</h1>
		<h2>Big Idea</h2>
			<p class="style">The goal for this lab is to teach us about the various styling techniques that are avaliable for us to use in CSS.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p class="style">The most difficult part of this lab was getting my styling to be something that I liked.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p class="style">This lab expanded on the aspects of a css file we learned about in the last lab. I feel as though I learned how to make a more personalized website and how to organize my page to a higher degree.</p>
