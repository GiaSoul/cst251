		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p>The goal for this lab was to make sure that we were able to organize our files for the class appropriately and to make sure we know how to link to subpages from our homepage.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The biggest challenge I faced was making sure I didn't forget to do any part of the assignment.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I feel like I know much more abut how to link varous pages and photos to one another.</p>
